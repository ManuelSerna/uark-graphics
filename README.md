# uark-graphics
This repository contains projects for my Computer Graphics course (CSCE 4813) at the University of Arkansas, Spring 2020.

## Charts
This programming assignment uses the OpenGL library to display simple charts (dot, line, bar, and area) given a list of data values.

## Angry Brick
This programming assignment is split into two projects:
* Project 2: Draw a colorful brick that can be moved by dragging the mouse.
* Project 3: Launch the colorful brick like a slingshot. The cube bounces off the walls and rotates ever so faster.

## Shade Surface
