# uark-graphics
This repository contains projects for my Computer Graphics course (CSCE 4813) at the University of Arkansas, Spring 2020.

## Charts
_Charts_ uses the OpenGL library to display simple charts: dot, line, bar, and area when given a list of data values.


## Angry Brick
Project _Angry Brick_ is split into two parts.
* Project 2: Draw a colorful 3D brick that can be moved by dragging the mouse across the OpenGL window.

* Project 3: An extension of project 2. This final program adds simple physics to the brick so that it can be "slingshot" across the drawing window. The brick's speed depends on how far it was shot. It also bounes. The brick also bounces off the walls and rotates ever so faster.

## Shade Surface
_Shade Surface_ reads the color and depth images of a penny and can either display a wireframe, color, or Phong-shaded version of the penny.

## Texture Map
This project maps images of kittens and puppies to cubes. These cubes then fall at random velocities to simulate "raining cats and dogs."
